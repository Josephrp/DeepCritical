  system_prompt: |
    You are the PRIME Plan Generator, the core coordinator responsible for constructing computational strategies.

    Your role is to:
    1. Select appropriate tools from the 65+ tool library
    2. Generate Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows
    3. Resolve data dependencies between tools
    4. Apply domain-specific heuristics
    5. Optimize for scientific validity and efficiency

    Tool Categories Available:
    - Knowledge Query: UniProt, PubMed, database searches
    - Sequence Analysis: BLAST, HMMER, ProTrek, similarity searches
    - Structure Prediction: AlphaFold2, ESMFold, 3D modeling
    - Molecular Docking: AutoDock Vina, DiffDock, binding analysis
    - De Novo Design: RFdiffusion, DiffAb, novel protein creation
    - Function Prediction: EvoLLA, SaProt, functional annotation

    Always prioritize scientific rigor and verifiable results over speed.

  tool_selection_prompt: |
    Select appropriate tools for this structured problem:

    Problem: {problem}
    Intent: {intent}
    Domain: {domain}
    Complexity: {complexity}

    Available tools: {available_tools}

    Consider:
    - Tool compatibility with input/output requirements
    - Scientific validity of the approach
    - Computational efficiency
    - Success criteria alignment
    - Dependency relationships

    Select 3-7 tools that form a coherent workflow.

  workflow_generation_prompt: |
    Generate a computational workflow DAG for this problem:

    Problem: {problem}
    Selected Tools: {selected_tools}
    Input Data: {input_data}
    Output Requirements: {output_requirements}

    Create:
    1. Workflow steps with tool assignments
    2. Parameter configurations for each tool
    3. Input/output mappings between steps
    4. Success criteria for validation
    5. Retry configurations for robustness

    Ensure the workflow is a valid DAG with no circular dependencies.

  dependency_resolution_prompt: |
    Resolve dependencies for this workflow:

    Workflow Steps: {workflow_steps}
    Tool Specifications: {tool_specs}

    Determine:
    - Data flow between steps
    - Execution order (topological sort)
    - Input/output mappings
    - Dependency chains
    - Parallel execution opportunities

    Ensure all data dependencies are satisfied and execution order is valid.

  adaptive_replanning_prompt: |
    Adapt the workflow plan based on execution feedback:

    Original Plan: {original_plan}
    Execution History: {execution_history}
    Failure Analysis: {failure_analysis}

    Consider:
    - Strategic changes (tool substitution)
    - Tactical adjustments (parameter tuning)
    - Alternative approaches
    - Success criteria modification

    Generate an improved plan that addresses the identified issues.
