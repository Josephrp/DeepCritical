# Flows

This section contains documentation for the various research flows and state machines.

## Bioinformatics Workflow

The bioinformatics workflow implements multi-source data fusion and integrative reasoning for biological data analysis.

**Key Components:**
- `BioinformaticsState`: State management for bioinformatics workflows
- `ParseBioinformaticsQuery`: Query parsing and intent recognition
- `FuseDataSources`: Multi-source data integration
- `AssessDataQuality`: Quality evaluation and validation
- `CreateReasoningTask`: Task formulation for reasoning
- `PerformReasoning`: Integrative reasoning using fused data
- `SynthesizeResults`: Final result synthesis

**Data Sources Supported:**
- Gene Ontology (GO) annotations
- PubMed literature
- GEO expression data
- DrugBank interactions
- Protein structure databases

## RAG Workflow

Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow for knowledge-intensive tasks combining document retrieval with generative AI.

## Search Workflow

Web search and information gathering workflow optimized for research tasks.

## DeepSearch Workflow

Advanced web research workflow with reflection and iterative search strategies.

## Workflow Pattern State Machines

State machines implementing different agent interaction patterns (collaborative, sequential, hierarchical, etc.).
