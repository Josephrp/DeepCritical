# 🚀 DeepCritical

**Hydra-configured, Pydantic Graph-based deep research workflow**

DeepCritical isn't just another research assistant—it's a framework for building entire research ecosystems. While a typical user asks one question, DeepCritical generates datasets of hypotheses, tests them systematically, runs simulations, and produces comprehensive reports—all through configurable Hydra-based workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔧 Hydra Configuration**: Flexible, composable configuration system
- **🔄 Pydantic Graph**: Stateful workflow execution with type safety
- **🤖 Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for different research tasks
- **🧬 PRIME Integration**: Protein engineering workflows with 65+ tools
- **🔬 Bioinformatics**: Multi-source data fusion and reasoning
- **🌐 DeepSearch**: Web research automation
- **📊 Comprehensive Tooling**: RAG, analytics, and execution environments

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Run a simple research query
uv run deepresearch question="What is machine learning?"

# Enable PRIME flow for protein engineering
uv run deepresearch flows.prime.enabled=true question="Design a therapeutic antibody"
```
