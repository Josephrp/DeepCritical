## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within DeepCritical, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to [security@deepcritical.dev](mailto:security@deepcritical.dev)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly if you have their contact information

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Your environment details (OS, Python version, DeepCritical version)
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

We will respond to security vulnerability reports within:

- **Initial Response**: 24-48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

### Security Considerations

DeepCritical handles various types of data and integrates with external services. Please be aware of the following security considerations:

#### Data Handling
- **Research Data**: DeepCritical processes research questions and scientific data
- **API Keys**: The system may handle API keys for external services (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Sensitive configuration data may be stored in config files
- **Output Data**: Research results and analysis outputs

#### External Integrations
- **AI Models**: Integration with Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, and other AI models
- **Web Search**: Integration with search APIs (Serper, etc.)
- **Databases**: Potential integration with various databases
- **Bioinformatics APIs**: Integration with scientific databases and APIs

#### Potential Attack Vectors
- **Code Injection**: Through malicious research queries or configuration
- **API Key Exposure**: Through logs, configuration files, or error messages
- **Data Exfiltration**: Through malicious tools or agents
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Through resource-intensive queries or infinite loops
- **Supply Chain**: Through malicious dependencies or tools

### Security Best Practices

When using DeepCritical:

1. **API Keys**: Store API keys securely and never commit them to version control
2. **Configuration**: Review configuration files for sensitive information
3. **Network**: Use secure networks when running DeepCritical
4. **Updates**: Keep DeepCritical and its dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual behavior or resource usage
6. **Sandboxing**: Consider running DeepCritical in a sandboxed environment for sensitive research

### Security Features

DeepCritical includes several security features:

- **Input Validation**: Strict input validation using Pydantic models
- **Tool Isolation**: Tools run in isolated environments where possible
- **Configuration Validation**: Hydra configuration validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Logging**: Configurable logging that can exclude sensitive data

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Confidentiality**: We will keep vulnerability reports confidential until resolved
2. **Coordination**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
3. **Credit**: We will give credit to security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities
4. **No Legal Action**: We will not take legal action against security researchers who follow responsible disclosure

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:

- **Patch Releases**: For critical security fixes (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2)
- **Minor Releases**: For important security improvements (e.g., 0.2.0)
- **Major Releases**: For significant security architecture changes (e.g., 1.0.0)

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: [security@deepcritical.dev](mailto:security@deepcritical.dev)
- **GitHub**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **Maintainers**: Contact project maintainers directly

### Acknowledgments

We thank the security research community for helping keep DeepCritical secure. Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in our security advisories and release notes.
